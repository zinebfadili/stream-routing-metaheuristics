Implemented a solution to the combinatorial optimization problem of routing streams through a Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) network, whereby some of the streams should follow multiple redundant routes.
Two different approaches used for this problem : constraint programming using Google OR-TOOLS CP-SAT solver, and simulated annealing.
